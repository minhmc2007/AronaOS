# AronaOS

Hello everybody out there using linux - I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like linux).

Welcome to AronaOS.

This is AronaOS. It's an operating system. If you don't know what an operating system is, you're probably in the wrong place.

## What is this?

AronaOS is my attempt at building an operating system. It might not be pretty, it might not even work, but it's mine. If you want something stable, go use linux.

## How do I build it?

If you have to ask, maybe you shouldn't.

But, just in case, here's the short version:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `make`.
3. Run `make run`
4. Pray.

If it builds, congratulations. If it doesn't, well, that's life.

## Why?

Because I can.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Or not. I'll look at them when I feel like it.

## License

Probably GPL. Check the LICENSE file if you care.

If you got this far, you probably know what you're doing. If not, well, good luck.

â€” Not Linus, but inspired by him.
